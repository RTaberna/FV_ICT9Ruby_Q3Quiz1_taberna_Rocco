        <h1>MOVIE REVIEWS</h1>
    <p>I will be reviewing the MCU's Spider-Man Trilogy featuring the famous Tom Holland as the beloved awkward teenager, Peter Parker, but is famously known for his persona as the Spider-Man</p>

                    <h4><strong>Spider-Man: Homecoming</strong></h4>
                    <p>Spider-Man: Homecoming occurs during phase 3 of the MCU's timeline. This movie takes place after the events of Captain America: Civil War. The movie follows Peter Parker, a young teenage boy who lives with his aunt after his parents passed away. The loss of his uncle Ben leads him to use his powers for good as all Spider-People do. Homecoming is arriving and Peter Parker wants to ask out his crush for the dance. Little does he know that his crush's father is the infamous Vulture. The movie was a great start for a new addition to the wide range of heroes in the cinematic universe. Spider-Man is supposed to be an awkward teenager and with respect I think that this interpretation of Peter Parker captured it better than the two other variations of Tobey Maguire and Anndrew Garfield.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Spider-Man: Far From Home</strong></h4>
                    <p>Spider-Man: No Way Home occurs during phase 3 and is the aftermath of what Spider-Man is after Tony Stark's death in Endgame. The movie revolves around how Peter Parker is dealing with the death of his father figure and also mentor, Tony Stark, after his sacrifice to win the battle against Thanos. We see the mental struggles Peter Parker has before and after he was given E.D.I.T.H., an A.I. created by Tony Stark. The movie also follows Quentin Beck, a "hero" from an aparent alternate universe which was destroyed because of the elementals. E.D.I.T.H. was eventually given to Mysterio by Spider-Man since Peter was reminded of Tony Stark because of Quentin. Little did he know that Mysterio was the big mad of the movie the whole time. Later in the end credit scene, the identity of Spider-Man was revealed to the whole world leading to the next movie. This movie was my least favorite out of the trilogy, I did not enjoy it as much compared to the other two and it shows in my rating.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Spider-Man: No Way Home</strong></h4>
                    <p>Spider-Man: No Way Home happens directly after the events of Far From Home, Peter's identity is revealed because of Quentin Beck. The movie revolves around how Peter handles his sudden doxxing by Quentin Beck and his "murder" of Mysterio which he did not do. He goes to Dr. Strange to seek help and ends up messing with the whole multiverse. Many villains from the old Sam Raimi and Marc Webb movies, Doc Ock, Sandman, The GReen Goblin, Electro,and Lizard. This messing with the whole multiverse thing ends up bringing the other Peter Parkers, who were portrayed by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. This movie I think is the best one out of the three and was a great ending to the whole trilogy. Since the MCU's Peter Parker was forgotten by the whole multiverse, maybe we get to see him reattatch himself to the world once again.</p>
